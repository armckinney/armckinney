Technical Lead specialized in the architecture, scaling, and evolution of Distributed Systems and Core Infrastructure.

My focus is on creating Force Multiplier effects—designing the abstractions and scalable primitives that empower engineering teams to deliver at speed. At DraftKings, I lead the design of high-throughput platform products where N-Scaling, data movement efficiency, and system resilience are mission-critical.

I believe that the best technical solutions are born at the intersection of Strategic Planning and Technical Humility. I don’t just build for the current requirements; I architect for the "next order of magnitude," ensuring that complexity is managed through elegant abstractions rather than brute-force engineering.

My Operating Principles:  
• Autonomy & Entrepreneurship: I treat platforms as products, focusing on self-service infrastructure that allows developers to move faster without friction.  
• Integrity & Open-Mindedness: I prioritize the best architectural outcome over personal ego, fostering a culture of rigorous peer review and collaborative problem-solving.  
• Creative Scaling: I enjoy solving the "unsolved" problems inherent in distributed environments—finding creative ways to balance performance, security, and flexibility.  

Core Competencies:  
• Systems Architecture: Distributed Systems, Data Movement, & Cloud-Native Infrastructure.  
• Technical Leadership: Strategic Roadmap Planning, Cross-functional Alignment, & Engineering Mentorship.  
• Platform Engineering: Designing for Scale, System Design, & Developer Experience (DevEx).

drew = AndrewMcKinney(role="Lead Engineer")

# Main Event Loop
while project.is_active():
    challenge = project.get_next_challenge()
    stakeholder_requirements = project.get_stakeholder_requirements()

    # Lead by example: Validate feasibility first
    poc = drew.develop_proof_of_concept(challenge)

    # Architect scalable solution based on POC findings
    solution = drew.create_proposal(
        poc,
        priorities=[
            stakeholder_requirements,
            "Security", 
            "Efficiency", 
            "Reliability", 
            "Flexibility"
        ]
